# Trial and Error: A Trial History and Bayesian Approach

_Our goal_ to build data pipelines for three separate analyses:

### **1. Individual Session Analysis**
Create a trial history pipeline to process and analyze data from single experimental sessions.

### **2. Comparing Conditions Within Subjects**
Design a trial history pipeline to compare performance and decision-making patterns across different experimental conditions for the same participant.

### **3. Group-Level Analysis**
Construct a pipeline to aggregate and analyze data across multiple participants, identifying consistent patterns and group-level trends in trial history effects.

## **Steps for Each Analysis**

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Write scripts to validate input data.
- Test preprocessing scripts on example datasets to handle edge cases and ensure compatibility.

### **2. Visualization**
- Implement simple and complex plots such as histograms, scatterplots, and reusable visualization templates.
- Design plots to clearly illustrate trial history effects and patterns.

### **3. Documentation and Building**
- Write clear and concise instructions and explanations for users.
- Build and maintain the README file for the project.
- Propose future features and extensions to enhance the pipeline.

### **4. Testing and Debugging**
- Test the pipeline on multiple datasets to ensure robustness.
- Identify and resolve possible bugs or unexpected behaviors.

### **5. Bayesian Modeling**
- Research Bayesian modeling techniques relevant to trial history analysis.
- Implement simplified versions, defining priors and likelihoods for specific tasks.
- Ensure results are interpretable and provide insights into decision-making patterns.
